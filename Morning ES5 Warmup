# Morning Warmup

1. Create a new HTML file called `es5-warmup.html`
2. Include the following HTML in the body:
	
	```	
	<main>
		<div>bob</div>
		<div>STEVE</div>
		<div>sAlLY</div>
	</main>
	```
1. Include script tags with the following object:

	```
	var name = {lName: "smith"};
	```
1. Write the needed JavaScript (without jQuery) to produce the following output in the browser:

	```
	Bob Smith
	Steve Smith
	Sally Smith
	```

If you have enough time, try refactor your code to express a solution as simply as possible.
